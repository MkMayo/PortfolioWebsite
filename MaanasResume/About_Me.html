		<p>Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! I'm delighted to share a glimpse of who I am and my journey as a Computer Science sophomore at the University of Florida (UF)</p>
		<p>From a young age, I was captivated by the boundless possibilities that the digital world offered. As I grew, so did my fascination with technology, and it was only natural that I pursued a degree in Computer Science to delve deeper into this rapidly evolving field.</p>
		<p>My primary focus lies in web development and app development. I find immense joy in crafting interactive and user-friendly websites and applications that serve as a bridge between technology and people. The process of bringing ideas to life through lines of code is both challenging and rewarding, and I continuously strive to stay up-to-date with the latest frameworks and best practices in the industry.</p>
		<p>While I thoroughly enjoy the technical aspects of development, I've also developed a keen interest in User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design. Understanding how users interact with technology and designing interfaces that provide seamless and enjoyable experiences have become a driving force behind my work. I believe that exceptional UX and thoughtful UI are critical elements in creating digital products that truly make a difference in people's lives.</p>
		<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, you'll often find me on the fencing piste, engaging in thrilling duels and mastering the art of swordplay. Fencing has taught me valuable lessons in discipline, strategy, and quick thinking â€“ all of which have proven to be remarkably beneficial in my programming endeavors.</p>
		<p>Basketball is another passion that keeps me physically active and mentally focused. The teamwork, communication, and determination required on the basketball court have had a positive influence on my problem-solving abilities and project collaborations.</p>
		<p>As I journey through my college years, I aspire to make a positive impact in the tech community and at UF. Whether it's through creating innovative applications, conducting user research, or engaging in intense fencing matches and basketball games, I'm determined to contribute my best to every aspect of my life.</p>
		<p>Thank you for stopping by and getting to know a bit about me. If you share similar interests or have exciting opportunities to collaborate, whether in technology or sports, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect and together explore the endless possibilities that technology and sports have to offer!</p>
